        <h1>The Bronx - Van Cortlan Park</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p> Van Cortlandt Park is a 1,146-acre (464 ha) park located in the borough of the Bronx in New York City. 
Owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation,
it is managed with assistance from the Van Cortlandt Park Conservancy and the Friends of Van Cortlandt Park. 
The park, the city's third-largest,
was named for the Van Cortlandt family, 
which was prominent in the area during the Dutch and English colonial periods.
The forest in what is now Van Cortlandt Park has been around for 17,000 years, 
since the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. <br><br>
The Wiechquaskeck Lenapes were among the first recorded people to inhabit in the area now referred to as Van Cortlandt Park. 
They settled in the area around the 14th or 15th centuries. 
The Lenapes used the geographic features of the area to support their community; 
for instance, they used the Tibbetts Brook, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, or Hudson River for fishing, and flatland areas for farming.

        <h1>Queens- Jacob Riis Park</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Jacob Riis Park, also called Jacob A.Riis Park or Jacob Riis State Park, 
is a seaside park at the southwestern end the Rockaway Peninsula in the New York City borough of Queens.
It lies at the foot of the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, adjacent to the east of Fort Tilden, 
and west of Neponsit and Rockaway Beach.
Originally a city-run park under the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, 
it is currently part of the Jamaica Bay Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area,
and is managed by the National Park Service.
<br><br>
    Plans emerged for a coastal park located in the Rockaways in the early 20th Century, 
     with the property acquired by the city in 1912. 
     Initially called Seaside Park and later Telawana Park, the park was named in 1914 for social journalist Jacob Riis, who advocated for the creation of the park. 
     During World War I, the site was used as the Rockaway Naval Air Station, 
     one of the first naval air stations in the United States. Riis Park was largely constructed between 1936 and 1937 by NYC Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, 
     who envisioned Riis Park as a getaway for New York City residents comparable to Jones Beach State Park on Long Island. 
     The park was built along with the Marine Parkway Bridge and the Belt Parkway in nearby Brooklyn, 
     which provided access to the park.

        <h1>Staten Island - La Tourette Park</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <p>LaTourette Park, like much of the surrounding area, 
was once the farm property of David (1786-1864) and Ann (1794-1862) LaTourette. 
The LaTourettes first established their farm in 1830. 
Over time the farm became one of the top producing family-run farms on Staten Island,
renowned for its superb produce. 
In 1928, the LaTourette family sold their farm to the City of New York. 
The site was transferred to Parks in 1955 and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1973. 
Although the original farmhouse was demolished, 
the LaTourette’s 1870 mansion is now used as a club house for the park’s golf course. 
In 1982, the mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
